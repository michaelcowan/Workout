# Terms
## Reps
A rep is a weight lifting movement with a positive part (concentric contraction) and a negative part (eccentric contraction).

## Sets
A set is a number of reps all done back to back.

## 4 x 8-12
This shows how many sets to do and what rep range to do them in e.g. 4 x 8-12 means 4 sets for 8-12 reps each.

# Workout
## General
Usually a workout will consist of several exercises targeting a muscle group.

In general you should perform 8-12 reps, for 4 sets, with 1 min rest in between sets. Use whatever weight allows you to stick to this rep range i.e. you can change the weight between sets.

Form should be very good (almost robotic like) where the weight moves in a controlled manner. Momentum, bouncing, arching etc should not be used to move the weight (weight lifter not weight thrower). The negative portion of the movement should be a little slower than the positive.

Training ever other day is a good way to start. You can work up to whatever you feel comfortable with but I would not go past 4 days back to back without a day off.
